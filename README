BeDrift is an implementation of a driftnet like application for
BeOS with BONE. BONE is required as the original net_server
(found in BeOS prior to BONE) does not have the required abilities 
to make it all work.

What does it do?
It sits and watches network traffic, reconstructing images (presently
JPG but uses translator so could handle anything BeOS knows about) and
then displays them on the screen.
